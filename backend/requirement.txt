firm setting

Of course.These operational settings are designed to automate and customize a firm's routine tasks, ensuring consistency, professionalism, and efficiency in their workflow.

## Default Payment Terms
What it is: This setting establishes the standard agreement for when a customer is expected to pay an invoice.

How it works: When a new invoice is created, this field automatically populates with the firm's chosen default term. This saves the user from having to type it out every time. Common terms include:

"Due on receipt": Payment is expected immediately upon receiving the invoice.

"Net 15" / "Net 30": Payment is due within 15 or 30 days of the invoice date.

"End of Month (EOM)": Payment is due by the last day of the month the invoice was issued.

    Example: A firm sets its default payment term to "Net 30".When a staff member generates a new invoice for a customer, the "Payment Due" section is automatically filled with a date 30 days from the current date, and the text "Payment Terms: Net 30" is added.

## Invoice Footer / Notes
What it is: This setting allows a firm to define a standard block of text that will appear at the bottom of every invoice they generate.

How it works: It acts as a template.The application will automatically append this saved text to all new invoices.This is crucial for providing important information consistently.

    Example: A firm sets its invoice footer to include their bank details for direct transfers and a polite thank you message.

Thank you for your business!
Bank Details:
Account Name: ABC Enterprises
Account No: 1234567890
IFSC: XYZN0001234
Now, every invoice automatically includes this information, reducing payment friction and improving customer relations.

## Starting Invoice Number
What it is: This setting allows a firm to control the numbering sequence of its invoices.

How it works: Instead of forcing every firm to start with invoice #1, this setting lets them define a starting point.The system will then auto - increment from that number for all subsequent invoices.

    Example: A business is migrating to your software from an old system where their last invoice was #2450. To maintain a continuous sequence, they set their "Starting Invoice Number" to 2451. The first invoice they create in your app will be #2451, the next will be #2452, and so on.This makes their accounting records seamless.

## Order Number Prefix
What it is: This setting adds a custom text prefix to all order numbers generated by the system.

How it works: The application will prepend this string to the auto - incrementing order number.This helps in branding and quick identification of documents.

    Example: A company named "Innovatech" sets its order number prefix to INV -.When they receive their 101st order, the system generates the Order Number INV - 101. This makes it immediately clear that INV - 101 is an order document, distinct from a customer ID or an invoice number(which might have its own prefix like INNO -).
